The Invention of Probability: Ten Rules of probability Every game designer should know.
Rule #1: Fractions and decimal are percents. 1/2, 0.5, 50% are the same example of above 
Rule #2: Zero to One - and that's it! 
Rule #3: "Looked for" Divided by "Possible outcomes" Equals probability. Rule #4: Enumerate! 
Rule #5: In certain cases, or Means add An ace from a deck of cards or a diamond: 4+13/52= 17/52. This is wrong because Ace diamond is mutually add in both sets. Rule #6: In certain cases, or Means Multiply
Rule #7: One Minus "Does"="Doesn't"
Rule #8: The sum of multiple Linear Random selection is Not Linear Random Selection Game designer who want to use mechanic of chance as tool in their games must know what kind of probability distribution curves they want, and know how to get it. With practice, probability distribution curves will be a very valuable tool in your toolbox.
Rule #9: Roll the Dice (monte carlo) 
Rule #10: Geeks Love showing OFF (Gombauld's Law)

Fractions, decimals, and percentages are interchangeable (e.g., 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%).
Probability values range from 0 to 1.
Formula: Looked for outcomes / Possible outcomes = Probability.
Enumerate all possible outcomes to ensure accuracy.
Handling mutually exclusive cases in "or" probability.
"And" probabilities may require multiplication.
Complement rule: 1 - Does = Doesn't.
Understanding probability distribution curves is crucial for designing mechanics.
Monte Carlo simulations are useful tools ("Roll the Dice").
Gombauld's Law: Geeks love showcasing their knowledge.
